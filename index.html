			<h3>Week 8:</h3>
			</header>
			<p>Published on <time datetime="2022-11-23">November 23, 2022</time></p>

				</ul>
				<p>One thing I had to consider this week is legal issues surrounding images. I have to make sure that all the images I use in my website I am legally allowed to use. To solve this issue I have decided to use my own images and screenshots. If I do need to use an image that is not my own I will make sure that the image is either copyright free or the creative commons licence is consistent with the way I will be using the image and credit the copyright owner the correct way.</p>
                <p>During my research, I came across an article on Developing Usable websites. In this article Cunliffe writes about the different models used to develop websites that are usable for the target demographic. Cunliffe mentions having user testing in all phases of development. User feedback can be used in the early planning stages of a website to evaluate the criteria of the websites as well as to work out what the end user wants. During development user feedback and testing can be used to evaluate parts of the website and make sure that the user can use the website. Once the website is finished user feedback can be used for additions as well as modifications to the site. It can also be used to correct any bugs or mistakes in the website. I chose to implement some of these methods in my website design process through peer review. By letting other people view and use my website during development I can see what changes need to be made in real time. I used people with varying knowledge into technology and website design to ensure that my website was usable by the majority of people. They viewed the website on multiple different browsers and devices to ensure that my mobile-first approach was implemented correctly. By using this model, I am ensuring that my website is the best it can be.</p>

			<h3>Week 9:</h3>
			</header>
			<p>Published on <time datetime="2022-12-16">November 16, 2022</time></p>
				<p> This week I created my basic contact page.</p>
				<p>In this tutorial I :</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Insert a form into the website </li>
					<li>Add form elements such as text input and textarea </li>
					<li>enhanced my basic from using HTML5's input types</li>
					<li>Used CSS to style my form </li>
					<li>Fixed a long standing issue where the heading of the table would not disappear in my media query. To find this solution is used <a href= "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59768112/hide-show-paragraph-with-media-query/"> Stack Overflow</a>.</li>
					<li>Validated my HTML with the W3C validator</li>
					<li>Validated my CSS with the W3C validator</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I used the HTML5 doctor's webpage on HTML5 form input types to learn more about the different attributes and how they appear on different devices. I also learnt about how these attributes mean that browsers and mobile phones show these differently. For example the date attribute is rendered differently in Chrome than Opera and is different from how a mobile phone would render it. I also learnt that on mobile phones the different attributes can cause the on screen keyboard to appear different. For example the Email attribute causes the keyboard to have a added "@" symbol as well as the "." symbol. It can also contain a ".com'' button depending on the make of the phone</p>
				<p id="hide">Here is a video documenting the development of my form.</p>
				<video width="640" height="360" controls>
